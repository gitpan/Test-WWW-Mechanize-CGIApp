Revision history for Perl module Test::WWW::Mechanize::CGIApp:

0.05 Wed Jul 11 08:47:21 PDT 2007
     - incorporate more comments from Mark Stosberg
       - refer to the app as "app", not instance.
     - get rid of the autorunmode_hack, it isn't needed (my
       misunderstanding).
     - cleanup docs and examples.

0.03 Sun Mar 11 22:03:58 PDT 2007
     - incorporate feedback from Mark Stosberg
     - pare down to two new methods, "instance", which describes the 
       way the test harness should fire up the run_mode, and "autorunmode_hack",
       which enables special handling for CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode.
     - fleshed out the pod docs.
     - finished the test suite (for now).

0.02 Wed Feb 28 11:43:35 PST 2007
     - make sure url's have a scheme, etc... before we muck around with
       cookies.  Otherwise code called by WWW::Mechanize throws a warning.

0.01 Wed Feb 28 09:26:35 PST 2007
     - initial version
